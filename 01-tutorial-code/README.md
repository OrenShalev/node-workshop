# Tutorial Code
This is the code seen in the tutorial part of the workshop.

It is divided into three parts:

1. *[Introduction to NodeJS](./01-intro-to-nodejs)*. This section assumes you know nothing about 
   NodeJS and teaches you the fundamentals.
1. *[ES6 in NodeJS](./02-es6)*. This section teaches you how to use ES6/ES2015 in 
   NodeJS, and the ways this can enhance your development.
1. *[Testing in NodeJS]((./03-testing)*. This section teaches you how to write tests in NodeJS.

Each section includes an ordered list of programs, where each program teaches
something small. What it teaches is listed in a comment at the end of the program.

Note that the [test](./test) folder contains a set of tests that run the above 
programs and verifies that the output is correct.
